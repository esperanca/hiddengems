**Kushida Shrine** is located in the center of Fukuoka. Its history goes back as early as 757 when Hakata was flourishing as a port city that welcomed delegations from mainlland China and Korea.

Fukuoka's famous summer festivals, **Hakata Gion Yamakasa** and **Hakata Okunchi**, start at this shrine. It goes without saying that the citizens deeply love this shrine.

The best times of day to visit Kushida Shrine in autumn are early morning and late afternoon. 

### Early Morning

- **4:00 AM Opening**: The shrine opens at 4:00 AM, allowing visitors to experience the tranquil atmosphere before the crowds arrive. Early morning visits provide a peaceful setting for prayer and reflection, and you can enjoy the serene beauty of the shrine and its surroundings as the day begins.

### Late Afternoon

- **Golden Hour**: Visiting in the late afternoon, particularly around sunset, offers beautiful lighting for photography and a chance to see the shrine illuminated by the warm glow of the setting sun. This time is also ideal for experiencing the evening rituals and the calming ambience as the day winds down.

### Additional Considerations

- **Cultural Events**: If your visit coincides with special events, such as the [[Hakata Okunchi Festival\|Hakata Okunchi Festival]] in October, plan to arrive earlier in the day to fully enjoy the festivities and avoid larger crowds.

You can make the most of your experience at Kushida Shrine during the beautiful autumn season by timing your visit to either early morning or late afternoon.
