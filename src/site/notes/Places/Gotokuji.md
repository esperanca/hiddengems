Gotoku-ji Temple is a family temple of the Ii Family, the lord of Hikone Domain, in Edo (former Tokyo). In addition to the Ii Family Graveyard of Gotoku-ji Temple, designated as the nation’s historical site, the temple is home to many cultural heritages related to the Ii Family, such as the Buddha hall and bell tower. There is also a legend that it is the birthplace of _maneki-neko_ (beckoning cat), and many _maneki-neko_ statues with their right paws raised invite good luck at the Shofuku-den Hall next to the Buddha hall.
