During autumn, Japan's landscapes transform dramatically as the lush greens of summer give way to a breathtaking array of reds, oranges, and yellows, a phenomenon referred to as "koyo" or autumn leaf viewing. 

The best time to experience this transformation varies by region, typically starting in mid-September in Hokkaido and moving southward, with peak colours occurring from late October to early November in many areas.
